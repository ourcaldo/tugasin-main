Before, we have a changes in sitemap generation function for the blog, please dig to that feature so you have better understand.

Now, i need you to edit again that function, when we call the API /sitemaps, the API will give data like this:
{
"success": true,
"data": {
"sitemaps": [{
"type": "root",
"url": "https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap.xml"
}, {
"type": "pages",
"url": "https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-pages.xml"
}, {
"type": "blog",
"url": "https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post.xml",
"index": "https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post.xml",
"references": ["https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post-1.xml", "https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post-2.xml", "https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post-3.xml", "https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post-4.xml"]
}]
},
"cached": false
}

As you see, the url is using "https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run" which is the cms endpoint. All is use that cms endpoint, except for the references in blog sitemap, which is inside https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post-1.xml will use loc our frontend domain tugasin.me .

Now, for the our sitemap blog itself is using /site sitemap-post.xml which now proxied to https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post.xml data, but we didn't change the domain yet.

So, this time I need you to made function, to make sure that not only proxied, but we also change the domain so it's using our url format, which is domain.com/sitemap-post.xml and the chunk version is /sitemap-post-1.xml and all of that will be proxied to their destination based on API response.

For example
domain.com/sitemap-post.xml -> proxied to https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post.xml
/sitemap-post-1.xml -> proxied to https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post-1.xml
and so-on.

For the chunk version inside the https://mc-0li8vr9j2f.bunny.run/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-post-1.xml we didn't change domain, as it's already use our frontend domain, the loc will be domain.com, not cms.domain.com.

Do you understand about this? If yes, you can start to fix this
