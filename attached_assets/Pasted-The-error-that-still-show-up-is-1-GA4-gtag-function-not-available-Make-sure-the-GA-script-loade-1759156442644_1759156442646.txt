The error that still show up is:
1. GA4: gtag function not available. Make sure the GA script loaded correctly - I already add the GA enviroment variables, but from the Google Analytics it's still not detected. Make sure the analytics is working. You can use manual implementation or module, i don't care as long it's working and standarized.
2. Error related to Blob Refused to create a worker from 'blob: record.js:4351 Refused to create a worker from 'blob:https://tugasin.me/e885e34c-95a6-4d6c-98b0-eb7f45207633' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' https://va.vercel-scripts.com https://*.posthog.com https://us-assets.i.posthog.com https://www.googletagmanager.com". Note that 'worker-src' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.

Related to CSP, I already ask you to allowing CSP from posthog using asterisk, so it's allowing all posthog, all analytics things includeing google, sentry, etc, Google font, and anything related to Google.

But, before you do it, please look up the plan and the current implementation so you know where's last part you implemented the phase.
Before you do code changes, make sure you're already understand all the things, beside that please also read this rules:
1. The implemented of the phase must be good documented, good refacotred (not a single file that handle all the function things), and it's must be standarized as production ready
2. After you implement the phase or sub-phase, give marks/checklist to note that it's done implemented, make sure to do this before you jump on another files.
3. No hardcoded, I don't want any hardcoded like credentials, url, or anything related to variables get it from .env.
